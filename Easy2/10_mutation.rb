What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

array1 = %w(Moe Larry Curly Shemp Harpo Chico Groucho Zeppo)
array2 = []
array1.each { |value| array2 << value }
array1.each { |value| value.upcase! if value.start_with?('C', 'S') }
puts array2
=end

# My initial guess is that the code will print out:
# the members of array2, which is the same as array1, including all letters with
# 'C' and 'S' as upcase... Let's see!

array1 = %w(Moe Larry Curly Shemp Harpo Chico Groucho Zeppo)

array1.each { |value| array2 << value }
array1.each { |value| value.upcase! if value.start_with?('C', 'S') }
